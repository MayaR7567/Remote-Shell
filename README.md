# Remote-Shell
A remote shell project made in Java with my teammate Shruti bhat. It implements a series of built in and external functions. The shell (command line) continually asks for user input, does something on the userâ€™s behalf, resets itself, and again asks for user input. 

<br/>To run the code download the zip folder, but to simply video some of the code you can view the individual java files.
